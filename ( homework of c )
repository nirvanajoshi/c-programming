( homework of c )



A loop control variable is basically a variable whose value determines whether a program exits a loop or continues executing the loop code.
 for example

 FOR I = 1 TO 10 (Here program will run upto 10 times)
   ... do things ... 
NEXT I 



Pseudocode is a simplified representation of an algorithm that uses the English language to describe coding logic
 For example
 average NUMS 
  SUM = 0 
  Count = 0 
  For each number I in NUMS 
    Add I to SUM 
    Add 1 to COUNT 
  End for 
  AVG = SUM divided by COUNT 
  Return AVG 
end

Conditions are statements that are created by the programmer which evaluates actions in the program and evaluates if it's true or false. 

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int number,result=1,i,power;
    printf("Enter the base number :");
    scanf("%d",&number);
    printf("Enter the power number:");
    for (i=1;i<=power;i++)                         /* Here i=1 is starting condition and i can goup to power is ending condition where i++   is                                                                                                              is increment condition*/
    {
      result=result*number;
    }
    printf("result is : %d",result);
    
    return 0;
}
