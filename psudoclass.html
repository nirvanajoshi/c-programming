        The first generation of computers relied on vacuum tube technology, which was
        the primary component for circuits. These vacuum tubes were large, generated a
        lot of heat, and consumed significant amounts of power. Due to these limitations,
        first-generation computers were enormous in size, often taking up entire rooms,
        and required specialized environments to operate. Input and output operations
        were performed using punched cards, and memory was based on magnetic drums.
        The programming was done in machine language, a low-level language that
        directly communicated with the hardware. These computers were primarily used
        for scientific calculations, military purposes, and business data processing. Notable
        examples include the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer),
        which was used for military applications, and the UNIVAC (Universal Automatic
        Computer), the first computer designed for business use.
